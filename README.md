# I created the 'Alan AI News Reader', a React-based web app that presents news articles using Material-UI components. The standout feature is the integration of Alan AI voice commands, allowing users to navigate and open news articles hands-free. The application dynamically fetches articles, provides a smooth-scrolling experience to highlighted articles upon voice request, and uses placeholders for missing images for a consistent look. The combination of React, Material-UI, and Alan AI ensured a user-friendly, interactive, and modern news-reading experience
